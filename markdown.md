# Markdown format text

This is an example of **Markdown**, the plain-text auto-formatting system. One of its benefits is that it can be "automagically" turned into all kinds of formats very easily, using software tools common to developers.

When combined with version control software like Git, it becomes extraordinarily powerful. It's very easy to see exactly which changes were made when and by whom. Also, because Markdown is so flexible in how it can easily convert to multiple formats, it works great as the *one canonical* way to store text copy (e.g. short stories, glossary definitions, and so on).
